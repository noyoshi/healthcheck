I set it up so that I would only be running a server on my laptop. This would allow me to not have a server running
with exposed ports on my remote workstation by accident. The daemon for the remote workstation will only try to connect
to my laptop's IP address, and I might add something in the future to make it sleep during non-working hours (or just not run it
while I am not working).
